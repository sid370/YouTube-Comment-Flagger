This works for me, but I don't get nearly as many matches as I would have liked to get. For example: I have txt files of amazon reviews for albums by genre. My rock genre file has about 70,000 words after it has been cleaned and stop words have been removed, but only 182 emotions are matched which is only 2-3 words out of 1,000. I might need a different/bigger emotion file list or maybe I should be measuring something else but I can't find a whole lot of lists online to use.
